Okay, the data gathering phase is complete, with some caveats.

*   **Baseline HTML (`[3]`):** I have the full source code of the existing page. It's a solid foundation with a terminal structure, Three.js setup, and command processing logic already in place. It even has a `RESUME_DATA` object, which I will heavily modify and expand.
*   **Profile Picture (`[1]`):** The image URL `https://i.ibb.co/jZxwXR2Y/1759419391197.png` is valid and I can see the photo. This will be used for the WebGL portrait and the fallback.
*   **LinkedIn URLs (`[2]`, `[4]`):** The `browse` tool failed to fetch the LinkedIn profile and certifications pages. This is common with sites that require logins or have bot protection.

**Contingency Plan:** The prompt provides all the necessary data as text. I will use the prompt's text as the single source of truth for all personal data, ignoring the failed LinkedIn browse attempts. This includes:
*   Headline: "Learning Java, C++, C, Python, JavaScript and MERN Stack | BS in DS @ IITM | BE CSIT @ MBMU | AI/ML enthusiast | Preparing to write 12M lines of code"
*   Email: `coehemang@gmail.com`
*   LinkedIn URL: `https://www.linkedin.com/in/coehemang/`
*   Experience: DRDO research intern (June 2025–Present, GANxART)
*   Education: IIT Madras (2023–2027) & MBMU (2023–2027)
*   Top Skills: Research Skills, Research Projects, GaN
*   Languages: Hindi (Native/Bilingual), English (Professional Working)
*   Certifications: Amazon Intro to SW Dev, SQL (Advanced), Intro to SQL, Basic Java, Full Stack Web Dev
*   Publications: Crushader Issue 1, Tips for Beginners in Code

**Refactoring and Enhancement Plan:**

1.  **HTML Structure:** The baseline structure is good. I will keep the `<canvas>`, fallback `div`, `terminal-container`, and `script` layout. I will rename the canvas ID to something more specific like `webgl-bg-canvas`.
2.  **CSS (`<style>`):**
    *   I will add the new theme palettes (`dusk`, `noir`) as `body.theme-dusk` and `body.theme-noir` classes, defining new sets of CSS variables for them.
    *   I'll refine the `.output-card` styling to better match the "Swiss grid with holographic textures" brief. This means more structured padding/margins and perhaps subtle gradient borders.
    *   I will ensure all UI elements are styled according to the active theme.
3.  **JavaScript (`<script>`):**
    *   **`RESUME_DATA` Object:** I will completely replace the contents of the baseline's `RESUME_DATA` object with the fresh, comprehensive data provided in the prompt.
    *   **`commands` Object:**
        *   I will add all the new commands: `timeline`, `certifications`, `publications`, `languages`, `achievements`, `references`, `availability`, `socials`, `mantra`.
        *   I will update existing commands (`whoami`, `experience`, `skills`, etc.) to pull from the new, more detailed `RESUME_DATA` object.
        *   The `help` command's output will be updated to include all the new commands.
    *   **`ThemeManager` (Refactoring `theme` command):**
        *   The current `theme` command is simple. I will expand it to cycle through all four themes (`neon`, `monochrome`, `dusk`, `noir`).
        *   I'll add logic to use `sessionStorage` to persist the theme choice. On page load, the script will check `sessionStorage` for a saved theme and apply it.
        *   Crucially, I'll make sure the Three.js scene also reacts to the theme change, updating shader colors or material properties accordingly. This will be a new function `webglController.setTheme(themeName)`.
    *   **`webglController` (Three.js):**
        *   The existing shader is a good start. I will enhance it.
        *   **Vertex Shader:** I will introduce more complex noise-driven displacement to give the portrait a more "liquid" or "holographic" feel.
        *   **Fragment Shader:** I will layer more effects:
            *   **Refraction:** Simulate a glass/crystal effect by distorting the texture coordinates based on a noise map.
            *   **Caustics:** Add a subtle, shimmering light pattern using another noise function and `uTime`.
            *   **Color Control:** I will add `uColorPrimary` and `uColorSecondary` uniforms. The `setTheme` function will update these uniforms to match the current theme's palette, making the WebGL art fully integrated with the UI theme.
        *   I will create a background particle swarm using `THREE.Points` and a `PointsMaterial` to add depth and atmosphere.
    *   **Animation:**
        *   I'll use GSAP for the initial loading animation and for animating the output cards into view, focusing on a smooth, choreographed feel.
        *   I will use `anime.js` for smaller, stateful interactions like link hovers or input focus, as the brief suggests.
        *   I will add a `prefers-reduced-motion` check to conditionally disable animations.

I will now construct the final HTML file based on this detailed plan.
